      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My name is Sasha Olukanni. I am an undergraduate at Brigham Young University-Idaho with a keen interest in web development and graphic design. I’m especially interested in learning how to create websites and applications that meet the end user’s goals, communicating effectively with team members to delegate work, finding and fixing bugs in code, and meeting tight deadlines for clients. Think about the last time you visited a website. Did everything go smoothly? That’s what I’ll be doing; I’ll be creating websites, and I also want to spend the rest of my career doing research and learning new technologies to offer unique creative solutions. If you’d like to know more about me, just go ahead and visit the website I’m creating.</p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>For those that would like to know more about me.</p>

        Welcome to my page!
        My first name is Sasha, and my last name is Olukanni. I was born and raised in Nigeria. I graduated from high school in 2020. I am currently in America furthering my studies.
        As a child, I visited America during the holidays with my family. This is my seventh semester at Brigham Young University-Idaho, and I'm majoring in web development.
        This semester I learned a lot about what I want to do as my future career. The class was not only engaging but very informative.
