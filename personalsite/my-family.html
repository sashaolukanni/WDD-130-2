                    My family has always been my support system. My mom, Folashade Olukanni, is a source of inspiration for me. She has always encouraged me to pursue my dreams and has been a constant pillar of support. Her favorite thing to tell me when i feel down is "I CAN"
                </p>
                <p>
                    My dad, Adesina Olukanni, is another important figure in my life. His wisdom and guidance have helped shape who I am today. He has always been there to offer advice and support whenever I needed it. He is my foundation, anytime i feel like I can noyt do it he makes sure i stand firm.

                    Both my parents serve as temple presidents, which has deeply influenced our family values and spirituality. Their dedication to their roles and the community is something I deeply admire.

                <p>
                    Additionally, I have 11 foster siblings, each of whom has enriched my life in different ways. Growing up in a large family has taught me the importance of compassion, sharing, and resilience.
