            <p>Welcome to the Rivers page of my portfolio. Here, I showcase my projects related to web development and design, specifically focusing on river-themed websites and graphics.</p>
            <p>Rivers are a crucial part of our ecosystem, and through my projects, I aim to highlight their beauty and importance. I combine technical skills with creative design to produce work that not only looks great but also serves a purpose.</p>
